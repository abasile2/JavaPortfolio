I took IT 145: Found in Application Development. I made some adjustments to both projects. The difference between the two is Paint2 uses a loop while Paint1
does not. I also made an adjustment where gallonsPaintNeeded is narrowed down to 4 decimal points. I also had to debug the file and figured out what I did wrong
since this is a project I had done in 2020.
